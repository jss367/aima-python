But the environment was already doing that for us, and in my 2D example it couldn't find all of the spots to clean efficiently so it would never stop anyhow. That's because it really needs to figure out which movements were helpful and to then learn how to move more efficiently. To do that we need to incorporate the performance in its movement rules."
